# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I have built a data pipeline that first collects tweets from New York Times, and stores them in a database. Next, the sentiment of tweets is analyzed and the annotated tweets are stored in a second database. Finally, the tweet texts and their corresponding sentiment scores are published on Slack at a finite time interval.
